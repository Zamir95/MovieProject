# MovieProject

Created a movie project whioch allows the user to add movies based on 5 different generes; Horror, Action, Romance, Comedy and Drama. The user can add
a rating for the movie if they liked it or a rating of what people think about the movie. User can also delete a movie if they no longer want to view the 
movie that they gave a rating for. 

The inspiration of this project was because I really enjoy watching movies and I wanted to test my skills with javascript, Html, and CSS. 

Below I have added Screnshots of the project. To run the project just download the folder with the files and open the index.html file. Emjoy
